import { Canvas, Controls, ArgTypes, Meta, Subtitle, Title } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as InputStories from './Input.stories';
 
<Meta of={InputStories} />
 
<Title>Input</Title>
<Subtitle>Semantic input text collection</Subtitle>

## Usage
```jsx
import { Input } from "base-ui/components/Input";
```

<Canvas of={InputStories.Base} />

## Reference

<ArgTypes of={InputStories.Base} exclude={['ref']} />


## Examples

### Variants
Use `variant` to stylize the input.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Variants} sourceState="none" />

### Sizing & roundness

Sizing of the input is controlled with `size` and `gutterSize` props. `size` sets the input to a specific control `height`, and `gutterSize` sets the horizontal padding.

Each `size` provides default values for `gutterSize`, as well as `font-size`. Each of these values can be overridden independently.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Sizing} sourceState='hidden' />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.Sizing}/>
</div>


### Start adornment

You can add arbitrary content to the beginning of an input with `startAdornment` &ndash; like a search icon.

Ideally, the spacing will look pretty good by default. If you need to customize the spacing:
- `gutterSize` determines the amount of spacing on the edges of the container, which you can fine-tune as needed.
  - If you need precise spacing not supported by `gutterSize`, use negative left margin on your adornment directly (e.g., `-ml-2`).
- The spacing between the adornment and the input is controlled with `gap` on the container, which you can customize as needed with Tailwind classes.

<Canvas of={InputStories.StartAdornment} />

### End adornment

You can add arbitrary content to the end of an input with `endAdornment` &ndash; like a clear button.

The same spacing guidance from `startAdornment` applies here.

End adornments are most commonly actions that are tucked tightly into the container frame. In these cases, you'll likely reach for negative right margin (e.g., `-mr-2.5`) to achieve that aesthetic.

<Canvas of={InputStories.EndAdornment} />

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable the input, greying it out and preventing user interactions.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Disabled} />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.Disabled}/>
</div>

### Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to mark the input as invalid. You decide how this state is removed, whether that's through `onFocus`, `onChange`, an `onSubmit` handler, etc.

Default visual styles will be applied, based on the `variant`. Additionally, `[data-invalid]` is applied to the container for custom styling.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Invalid} />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.Invalid}/>
</div>

### Auto select text

Pass `autoSelect` to select all text in the input &ndash; useful when pairing with other copy actions. This prop behaves like an imperative action when toggled and allows selection to change.

<Canvas of={InputStories.AutoSelect} />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.AutoSelect}/>
</div>

### Autofill extensions

By default, autofill extensions are prevented by `Input`. For the occasions where you want browser extensions to be present, pass `allowAutofillExtensions` to remove the disabling.

When `name` is passed, or `type` is set to `"password"`, this value will default to `true`.

<Canvas of={InputStories.AutofillExtensions} />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.AutofillExtensions}/>
</div>

### With button

You can pair `Input` and `Button` components together by using the same `size` value.

<Canvas of={InputStories.WithButton} />
<div className="canvas-controls-only">
<Controls of={InputStories.WithButton}/>
</div>

### Optical alignment

Use `opticallyAlign` with either `"start"` or `"end"` to offset the gutter of the input.

<Canvas of={InputStories.OpticalAlignment} sourceState="none" />
