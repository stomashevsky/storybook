## Examples

### Custom views
You can fully customize the styling and rendering of select's trigger and options:
- **Trigger** &ndash; `triggerClassName`, `TriggerStartIcon`, and `TriggerView`
- **Options** &ndash; `optionClassName`, `OptionView`, as well as `description` and `tooltip` fields in `options`

<Canvas of={SelectStories.CustomViews} />

### Actions
Custom, arbitrary actions can be displayed below the options list via the `actions` prop.
<Canvas of={SelectStories.Actions} />

### Grouped options
Select supports option groups, similar to All selects are searchable by default, but will only present a searchbox when it makes sense. Currently, this means when there are 15 or more options.
<Canvas of={SelectStories.GroupedOptions} />

### Multiple selection
Multiple selection is supported through the `multiple` property. This changes how `value`, `onChange`, and `TriggerView` are typed, accepting and returning arrays of values.
<Canvas of={SelectStories.MultiSelect} />
